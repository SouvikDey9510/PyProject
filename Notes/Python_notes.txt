method overriding
method overloading is not supported in python because here we can not create two methods with same name.

Python is dynamically typed, which means that the type of a variable is checked during runtime, not in advance. This allows for more flexibility in writing your code.
Python is an interpreted language, which means that the code is not converted to machine-readable code before it is run. This makes Python ideal for scripting and rapid application development.
Python supports generators and coroutines, which allow you to write efficient code, especially when dealing with large data sets or I/O operations.
Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
