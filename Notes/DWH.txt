fact table: A fact table is a central component of a data warehouse. It contains quantitative data (facts or measures) related to a specific business process or activity. facts include sales revenue, quantities sold, profit margins, and other measurable metrics.
dimension table: Dimension tables describe business entities, such as people, products, places, and time. dimension tables provide context and descriptive attributes.
star schmea: A star schema is a multi-dimensional data model used to organize data in a database for easy understanding and analysis.
snowflake schema: A snowflake schema is an extension of the star schema. In a snowflake schema, dimension tables are broken down into subdimensions. It is more normalized than a star schema, resulting in storage efficiency but potentially slower query performance. Snowflake schemas are commonly used in OLAP data warehouses and relational databases.
normalization: Normalization is the process of organizing data in a way that reduces repetitious data. It involves removing redundancy and ensuring data integrity. Normalized data models follow high standards of data organization, while denormalized models sacrifice some normalization for faster query performance.
